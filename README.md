# Copier-Info-

Basically Who's Copying Me ( And Failing At It. . ) 


They're Simply Going Around And Copying My Style And Such. I Know Hiding Them Is An Option ( I Have.) But It's Not Stopping Them From Just Straight Up Copying My Skins ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ 

Including My ALESSI ( I Have A Ss, HOW DO I DO THIS ON MOBILE.) And It's Not Even Correctly Done ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

THIS ISN'T REALLY A CALLOUT, IT'S JUST STRAIGHT UP FUNNY, PLEASE. 

If You See Them Thinking They're Me. Check The Github. I Always ALWAYS Have Mine Linked! 

I'll Grab Their Info If I Can, This Isn't A Sign To Go Attack Them, It's Simply Just Raising Awareness To Anyone Who's Interacted With Them Thinking It's Me, Or Have Been Copied, It's A Horrible Experience For Many. One For Me As Well.
